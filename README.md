##Getting Started
###Prerequisites
* A-Frame
* Aframe-animation-component
* React
* React-Dom

### Install
Using npm or yarn:
```bash
$ npm i --save aframe-react-stories
or
$ yarn add aframe-react-stories
```

## Usage
In React:
```javascript
import Stories from 'aframe-react-stories';
```

## Setup
####Profile:
Each profile should to be formatted as shown below

```javascript
{
  displayName: 'John',
  img_url: 'http://yourprofileimage.com/profile.jpg'
  stories: [
    {
      type: 'image/jpeg',
      src: 'http://yourstoryimage.com/image.jpg'
    },
    {
      type: 'video/mp4',
      src: 'http://your360video.com/video.mp4'
    }
  ]
}
```
The aframe-react-stories component takes in a **user** prop and **friends** prop. The **user** prop should be a single profile and the **friends** prop should be a list of profiles.

####Media Type:
Pictures will need to be specified with the type, 'image/jpeg', 'image/png', 'image', etc..., in order for aframe-react-stories to display the media in the `img` tag under assets.  Otherwise, all other types will default to playing in the `video` tag.

####Assets Callback:
The aframe-react-stories component takes in a callback function through the `assetsCallback` prop.  Once mounted, the aframe-react-stories component will run a process that tags all the video and image assets for the stories playback logic. It will then pass the processed assets into callback function in the `assetsCallback` once it's done. The list of assets returned needs to be saved inside `<a-assets>` tag for the component to work properly.

####View Callback:
This callback is invoked every time a story is played. It should take in an object that contains the current story and metadata.
